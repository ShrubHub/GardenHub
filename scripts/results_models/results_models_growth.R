# Results models for growth differences comparing northern and southern willows
# in the garden to their source populations
# by Erica Zaja, created on 13/12/2022
# Last update: 14/12/2022

# growth: canopy height, shrub width, stem elongation, stem diameter over time 
# model structure: 
# lmer(growth_variable ~ population*site + sample_age +(1|sample_year/species/sample_ID))
# N.B Site is (a) common garden, (b) Kluane, (c) QHI. 
# population: is (a) common garden northern, (b) common garden southern, (c) source
